<p><h3>My Lifetime Line</h3></p>
<p> <h5> My name is Toni Lorita Roton, I am 16, and my birthday is November 30th, 2001.
    I was born in Muncie, Indiana and was removed from my bio home at seven months and was seperated from my three sisters.
    We all moved back home a six weeks later.
    I was removed from my biological parents home the second time at a year old. 
    After my parents lost their rights I was transported to
   <a href="http://carmelitedcjnorth.org/apostolate/st-joseph-s-carmelite-home-holy-innocents-center" title: "The carmolite home website".> 
    the carmelite home</a> After two years of being their with my three bio sisters, someone came and picked us up and took us home with them.
     We were happy to leave but we were disapointed with the abusive home we ended up in.
    When the abuse was discovered, we entered the foster care system and placed in a temporary home.
    A month later we were picked up again and moved to a foster home for seven years.
    When the parents backed out of the adoption three times, we were introduced to a new family.
    This family decided to adopt all of us after a <strong>year</strong> of us being in their care.
    This was <em>finally</em> our forever home.
    In all, I lived in Muncie IN , East Chicago IN, Mererville IN, Schererville IN, and currently in Indianapolis IN.</h5></p>
